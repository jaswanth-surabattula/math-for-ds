# System of Equations

## Introduction
A system of equations is a set of two or more equations that have common variables. The goal is to find the values of these variables that satisfy all the equations in the system.

## Types of Sentences in a System of Equations

### Complete Sentences
A complete sentence (or independent equation) in a system is an equation that provides unique information about the variables. Each complete sentence helps us narrow down the possible solutions.

**Example:**
\[ \begin{cases} 
2x + 3y = 6 \\
x - y = 2 
\end{cases} \]

### Redundant Sentences
A redundant sentence is an equation that doesn't provide new information because it can be derived from other equations in the system.

**Example:**
\[ \begin{cases} 
2x + 3y = 6 \\
4x + 6y = 12 
\end{cases} \]
The second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2.

### Contradictory Sentences
A contradictory sentence is an equation that conflicts with others, making it impossible to find a solution that satisfies all equations simultaneously.

**Example:**
\[ \begin{cases} 
2x + 3y = 6 \\
2x + 3y = 7 
\end{cases} \]
The same expression $2x + 3y$ cannot equal both 6 and 7.

## Singular and Non-Singular Systems

### Singular Systems
A singular system is a system of equations that does not have a unique solution. This can happen if the system has either no solutions or infinitely many solutions. Singular systems usually occur when the equations are dependent or contradictory.

**Example with No Solutions:**
\[ \begin{cases} 
x + y = 1 \\
x + y = 2 
\end{cases} \]

**Example with Infinite Solutions:**
\[ \begin{cases} 
x + 2y = 4 \\
2x + 4y = 8 
\end{cases} \]
The second equation is just the first one multiplied by 2.

### Non-Singular Systems
A non-singular system is a system of equations that has exactly one unique solution. This means all the equations in the system are independent and consistent.

**Example:**
\[ \begin{cases} 
x + y = 2 \\
x - y = 0 
\end{cases} \]
This system has the unique solution $x = 1, y = 1$.

## Summary
Understanding the types of sentences in a system of equations helps us determine whether we can find a unique solution. Complete sentences provide unique information, redundant sentences do not add new information, and contradictory sentences make the system unsolvable. Additionally, singular systems do not have a unique solution, while non-singular systems do.
