# Geometric Notion of Singularity

## Introduction
In Linear Algebra, the concept of singularity refers to the properties of matrices and their corresponding systems of equations. A matrix is singular if it does not have an inverse, which translates to specific geometric configurations of lines and planes in space.

## Singular and Non-Singular Systems
- **Non-Singular Systems**: These systems have a unique solution. Geometrically, this means:
  - In 2D, two lines intersect at exactly one point.
  - In 3D, three planes intersect at exactly one point.

- **Singular Systems**: These systems do not have a unique solution. They either have no solution or infinitely many solutions. Geometrically:
  - In 2D, lines are either parallel (no solution) or coincident (infinite solutions).
  - In 3D, planes may be parallel, coincident, or intersect along a line.

## Geometric Interpretation

### 2D Example (Lines)
Consider the system:
$`
\begin{cases}
3a + 2b = 8 \\
6a + 4b = 16
\end{cases}
`$
These lines are coincident (one is a multiple of the other), representing infinitely many solutions. Geometrically, they lie on top of each other.

### 3D Example (Planes)
Consider the system:
$`
\begin{cases}
x + y + z = 6 \\
2x + 2y + 2z = 12 \\
-x - y - z = -6
\end{cases}
`$
These planes are coincident (each is a multiple of the others), representing infinitely many solutions. They all lie on the same plane.

## Determinant and Singularity
- The determinant of a matrix indicates if it is singular or non-singular.
  - If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular (no unique solution).
  - If the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is non-singular (unique solution).

## Geometric Notion Summary
- **Non-Singular**: Unique intersection point (e.g., unique solution in systems of equations).
- **Singular**: Parallel or coincident lines/planes (e.g., no solution or infinitely many solutions).

Understanding singularity helps in visualizing the solutions and properties of systems of equations in both 2D and 3D spaces, linking algebraic properties with geometric interpretations.
